Reversing the code we end up with the following constraints:

x3 = x2 - 8
x5 = x4 - 2
x6 = x1 - 3
x10 = x9 + 5
x11 = x8 - 5
x12 = x7 + 4
x13 = x0 - 1

To get the maximum:

x2 = 9 => x3 = 1
x4 = 9 => x5 = 7
x1 = 9 => x6 => 6
x10 = 9 => x9 = 4
x8 = 9 => x11 = 4
x12 = 9 => x7 = 5
x0 = 9 => x13 = 8

The answer is: 99919765949498
