Reversing the code we end up with the following constraints:

x3 = x2 - 8
x5 = x4 - 2
x6 = x1 - 3
x10 = x9 + 5
x11 = x8 - 5
x12 = x7 + 4
x13 = x0 - 1

To get the minimum:

x3 = 1 => x2 = 9
x5 = 1 => x4 = 3
x6 => 1 => x1 = 4
x9 = 1 => x10 = 6
x11 = 1 => x8 = 6
x7 = 1 => x12 = 5
x13 = 1 => x0 = 2

The answer is: 24913111616151
